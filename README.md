# Custom Cadastre Automation Extension

## Introduction
Hello, I'm dumitraa! I developed this Chrome extension as a part of my journey into computer science. Despite being a data entry operator in a non-CS role, I created this tool to enhance efficiency and automation within our data entry processes.

## Background and Inspiration
When I first encountered our company's "low-code" BPM platform, I quickly noticed its limitations. Tasks that could be streamlined into a few clicks were drawn out over days, sometimes weeks. This inefficiency spurred me to action. My journey began modestly, crafting simple scripts for personal use. I used Scripty to inject keyboard shortcuts, field entries, checkbox automations, and more into the platform.

However, these initial scripts had a catch â€“ their values were hardcoded. Each time a different input was needed, manual changes were necessary, leading to a new kind of inefficiency. My boss noticed my efforts and half-jokingly encouraged me to continue my "disappointment" with the platform, pushing me to expand my scriptwriting.

Seven months into this process, I realized the potential to share these benefits with my colleagues. While initially, I shared my scripts with a few team members, the need to constantly assist them indicated a need for a more scalable solution. This led me to the idea of developing a Chrome extension. 

Embarking on this new challenge without prior experience in building extensions meant a steep learning curve. It took me two months of dedication and learning, but the result was a functional tool that significantly improved our workflow. Although there are still some areas needing refinement, the extension has been well-received by my colleagues, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing our daily operations.


## Key Features
- **User Customization:** Enables users to personalize automation settings.
- **Page Element Monitoring:** Uses MutationObserver for real-time webpage interactions.
- **Data Entry Automation:** Facilitates quicker field entries, option selections, and checkbox toggling.
- **Chrome Local Storage and XPath Lookup:** Utilizes Chrome's local storage for user settings and XPath Lookup for element selection.
- **Tailored for Company's Platform:** Specifically designed for our company's internal website.

## Accessing the Extension
This extension is tailored for our company's internal use and requires an account on our platform. You can find it here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asistent-topomind/djcblgpccapjelfdpmbknhfpnlnlppjg.

## How It Works
Once installed, users can select features and customize settings as needed. The extension activates on specific internal pages, automating tasks based on user-defined conditions.

## Future Plans
While the platform this extension supports is being phased out, I am committed to optimizing the code and improving user experience in its remaining lifecycle.
